Here we will use dstep (https://github.com/jacob-carlborg/dstep) to assist in
conversion of htslib header files to D modules in the `htslib.*` namespace.

Importantly, dstep does not get things 100% right (or when it does, we may
prefer e.g. an inline function instead of a generic templated fn to replace
a #define; or we may wish to add deprecated("...") etc.), and so we will store
a patch for each (?) file to track any further transformation(s) before it can
go in-tree. 

This will also be critically important when upgrading the bindings to a new
library version, so that we do not have to manually track fixes to the auto-
mated conversion and can re-apply them (assuming `patch` can locate the hunk)

To update bindings:
```bash
make clean
cp htslib/htslib/* source/htslib/include/
make
```

Patch files under patches are used to patch the output from dstep.
Patch files under changes are simplified to filter out changes
in whitespace and comments.
